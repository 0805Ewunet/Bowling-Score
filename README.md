One game of bowling consists of 10 frames.
Each frames consisted of 2 chance to know down 10 pins, but it takes you both tries. In this case, your score for the frame is 10 plus the number of pins you knock down with you one next roll. In all other cases, your score for the frame is the number of pins you knock down.

Extra rolls.
If you bowl a strike in the last frame, you are awarded two extra rolls.
Bowling a spare in the last time (firs two rolls add up to 10) gets you one extra roll.
In both cases, you net score for the last frame is the total number of pins
